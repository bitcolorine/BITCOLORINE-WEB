	<h1>About Luisa</h1>


		<p><p>
					I've been making websites since 1997? Probably.
					I learned with a book and a very slow computer. The first thing I put online was my very own 'Homepage' with poems by Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath, plus quotes from the tortured souls of the 90's grunge bands. Very dramatic stuff.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					In 1999 I opened my first blog on Blogger. Back then you had the chance to publish your blog to your own server while still using the Blogger app. 
					I had much fun desigining and re-desigining my blog sometimes five times in a year. 
				</p>
		
		<p>In 2006 I moved to Montreal with the man of my life and I started searching for a new career. I wanted to do something different: I considered teaching, becoming a librarian, a dog groomer a breadmaker, anything but working in a large corporation. Finally I started to work at a bookstore and in a matter of weeks I became the web manager and a short time afterward the ecommerce manager.
		</p>
		<p>In 2013 my husband and I started preparing for a sabbatical in 2014. I would lose my job and in a moment of panic I realized that all my experience and my skills lie in web devopment. </p>
		
		Though I love the internet I have a more careful approach. I belive three things:
		1. You have the own your content.
		2. You are responsible for your privacy especially today.
		3. The holograms of internet bliss are just holograms. The real work is done offline. When the power is out none of this exists. (reference).
		
		With this in mind, I prefer to work with:
		Open source or Bootsrapped businesses.
		Are you curious why? Read here.
		
		When I'm not coding websites I read and write. And I'm a compulsive learner. 
		I publish two other blogs you can visit here and here. Sometimes I publish pieces in Spanish like this one.
		I like to make bread.
		
		I'm a fan of the underground, the new, the unknown, the people who make things for the sake of it. Between a magazine and a zine I will always choose the zine. I collect books by female British authors for their elegance and economy of language, sense of humour and because I love that in every single one of those books there is the inevitable scene of tea and scones.
		
		By the way, if you must know, the best scones in Montreal are found at Rustique.</p>
