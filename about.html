	<h2>About</h2>

	<h3> Hi, I'm Luisa. </h3>


<p>I'm a front end-web developer, post-librarian, a writer and a bookseller. I work to create simple, effective, accessible and easy to maintain websites for small businesses and entrepreneurs who don't want to feel overwhelmed with tech-speak but want to have a solid web presence.</p>
<p>I believe in: good code, owning your content, accessibility over features and being able to grow your website with your business. 
Would you like to know more?
</p>
<p>I believe that a website is created to work for your business but we need to find out what your business actually needs. </p>

<p>A well coded website is like a well built house, but it doesn't need to be huge.
The more rooms you add to a house, the more you have to clean it, furnish it, repair it and well, maintain it.</p>
<p>The more features you add to your site without really needing them, well, you guessed it: you will have to maintain.
Your website should do a few things, but it should do them well:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Bring you new clients? How? What do you want them to do?</li>
    <li>Be accessible to everybody: on their phones, tablets and computers.</li>
    <li>Be easy to update to keep your clients informed and engaged.</li>
</ol>


<p>And if your business grows?</p> 

    <p>Your website should too.</p>


<h3>Let's work together.</h3>
