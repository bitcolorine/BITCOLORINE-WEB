		<h3>Make me my first website</h3>
		<p> This service is designed for people who are new to the joys and responsibilities of having a website. For people who struggle to find the right developer, the right type of site, and who do not want or need to know techspeak. </p>

		<p> By the end of the project, you will have a business website that is: </p>
		<ul>
		<li> Well coded </li>
		<li> Easy to maintain </li>
		<li>That can grow with you.<li>
		<li> And best of all, youâ€™ll have the experience of knowing how to make it work for you.</li>
		</ul>

		Grab your idea book and your buisness plan and get ready to build the website that fits your business.

		I have availability to take on projects starting December 2013.
